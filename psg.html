    <p>Paris St Germain, AC Milan, Juventus and Inter Milan are among eight clubs who have agreed settlements with UEFA after failing to comply with break-even requirements last season, European soccer's governing body said on Friday
        The eight clubs have agreed to fines totalling 172 million euros ($172.50 million) of which 26 million euros must be paid in full with the balance conditional on compliance with targets laid out in their respective settlement agreements.
        
        PSG, AS Monaco and Olympique de Marseille of France, Italy's champions Milan and Juve plus Turkey's Besiktas have reached settlements covering the next three years, while Inter and AS Roma agreed four-year settlements, UEFA said in a statement.
        Of the eight, French champions PSG are liable for the biggest fine of 65 million euros, of which 10 million euros must be paid in full, followed by Roma, who are liable for a penalty of 35 million euros, five million of which must be paid in full.
        
        UEFA announced new sustainability regulations earlier this year to replace the previous Financial Fair Play (FFP) system.
        The new stability requirements, known as the football earnings rule, came into effect from June 1.
        Under the new rules, acceptable losses have doubled from 30 million euros to 60 million euros over three years. read more
        The clubs that have agreed a three-year settlement have until the end of the 2025-26 season to comply with the new UEFA sustainability rules, failing which they can be held liable for the full amount of the fines set by UEFA.
        
        Failure to comply could also result in the clubs being banned from UEFA competition in the 2024-25 and 2025-26 seasons, as well as being banned from registering new players in the 2026-27 season.
        Inter and Roma have one additional season to comply with the new rules.
        Nineteen other clubs, including Manchester City, Chelsea, West Ham United, Leicester City and Barcelona avoided punishment due to the emergency relief measures UEFA instituted during the COVID-19 pandemic or because they had benefited from historically positive break-even results.
        UEFA said it had asked these 19 clubs for more financial information and told them they would be monitored closely in future as neither COVID-related deductions nor historical finances would be considered from the next financial year.
