    <p>A recent Disney social media post with Hugh Jackman's Wolverine sparks speculation that an MCU X-Men announcement could come next week.A new post from Disney sparks speculation that an X-Men announcement for the Marvel Cinematic Universe is coming next week. Marvel Studios gained access to mutants for the first time in 2019 when Disney acquired 20th Century, reverting the X-Men movie rights back to Marvel. The last three years have been filled with rumors and speculation about how and when the X-Men will join the MCU. So far, Marvel Studios has yet to make any official announcements regarding an MCU X-Men reboot. This included the mutants being noticeably absent from the Multiverse Saga slate unveiling at San Diego Comic-Con 2022.
        Mutants are starting to play a role in the MCU in Phase 4, however. Ms. Marvel's finale included the big twist revealing that Kamala Khan is a mutant. Audiences also were treated to Patrick Stewart's return as Professor X in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. The internet was also recently buzzing after She-Hulk: Attorney At Law seemingly confirmed Wolverine exists in the MCU. However, Marvel Studios has only announced plans for one project starring an X-Men character, as Ryan Reynolds will return for Deadpool 3.</p>
